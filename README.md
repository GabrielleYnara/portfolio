# Gabrielle Ynara - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This is an ongoing project to showcase my development skills and apply the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained through both my professional and independent projects. The portfolio reflects my learning journey, focusing on accessibility, mobile-first design, and creating dynamic, user-friendly content.

## Features
- **Accessible Design**: Built with accessibility standards in mind, ensuring compatibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Bilingual Support**: English and Portuguese language toggle.
- **Mobile-First Development**: Responsive across devices, focusing on performance and usability.
- **Dynamic Content**: Integrated dynamic content using JavaScript and Formspree API for email submission on the contact page.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic content and interactivity.
- **Sass**: Streamlined, maintainable stylesheets.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Core structure and styling.
- **Formspree**: Handling contact form submissions.

## Learning Journey
This portfolio has been a constant learning experience. I started the project during my Software Engineering Immersive course and have continuously updated it as I learn new concepts and tools.

One of the most significant features to implement was the bilingual toggle option. As a Brazilian developer, this was a rewarding opportunity to provide content in both **English and Portuguese**, ensuring that my portfolio reflects not only my technical skills but also my cultural background. It allowed me to apply **best practices for localization**, such as adapting content for multiple languages and ensuring design flexibility to accommodate different text lengths.
